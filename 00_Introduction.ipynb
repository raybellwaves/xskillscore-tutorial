    "The verification metrics in `xskillscore` are split into two types: **deterministic** and **probabilistic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic** metrics consist of correlation metrics (e.g. [pearson r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)) and distance metrics (e.g. [root-mean-square error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation)). These metrics adapt the implimentation in [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic** metrics can be calculated when the forecast consists of multiple forecasts for the same target. Examples, include [Continuous Ranked Probability Score](https://climpred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/metrics.html#continuous-ranked-probability-score-crps) and [Brier Score](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0493%281950%29078%3C0001%3AVOFEIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2).\n",
